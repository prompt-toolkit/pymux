Issues, questions, wishes, comments, feedback, remarks? Please create a GitHub
issue, I appreciate it.


Installation
------------

Simply install ``pymux`` using pip:

::

    pip install pymux

Start it by typing ``pymux``.


What does it do?
----------------

A terminal multiplexer makes it possible to run multiple applications in the
same terminal. It does this by emulating a vt100 terminal for each application.
There are serveral programs doing this. The most famous are `GNU Screen
<https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/>`_ and `tmux <https://tmux.github.io/>`_.

Pymux is written entirely in Python. It doesn't need any C extension. It runs
on all Python versions from 2.6 until 3.5. It should work on OS X and Linux.


Compared to tmux
----------------

To some extent, pymux is a clone of tmux. This means that all the default
shortcuts are the same; the commands are the same or very similar, and even a
simple configuration file could be the same. (There are some small
incompatibilities.) However, we definitely don't intend to create a fully
compatible clone. Right now, only a subset of the command options that tmux
provides are supported.

Pymux implements a few improvements over tmux:

- There is a completion menu for the command line. (At the bottom of the screen.)
- The command line has `fish-style <http://fishshell.com/>`_ suggestions.
- Both Emacs and Vi key bindings for the command line and copy buffer are well
  developed, thanks to all the effort we have put earlier in `prompt_toolkit
  <https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit>`_.
- Search in the copy buffer is highlighted while searching.
- Every pane has its own titlebar.
- When several clients are attached to the same session, each client can watch
  a different window. When clients are watching different windows, every client
  uses the full terminal size.
- Support for 24bit true color. (Disabled by default: not all terminals support
  it. Use the ``--truecolor`` option at startup or during attach in order to
  enable it.)

About the performance:

- Tmux is written in C, which is obviously faster than Python. This is
  noticeable when applications generate a lot of output. Where tmux is able to
  give fast real-time output for, for instance ``find /`` or ``yes``, pymux
  will process the output slightly slower, and in this case render the output
  only a few times per second to the terminal. Usually, this should not be an
  issue. If it is, `Pypy <http://pypy.org/>`_ should provide a significant
  speedup.

The big advantage of using Python and `prompt_toolkit
<https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit>`_ is that the
implementation of new features becomes very easy.

Why create a tmux clone?
------------------------

Just like `pyvim <https://github.com/jonathanslenders/pyvim>`_ (A ``Vi`` clone
in Python.), this is another experiment. A hobby project to challenge the
design of prompt_toolkit. The development resulted in many improvements in
prompt_toolkit, especially performance improvements, but also some
functionality improvements.

The development is especially interesting, because it touches so many different
areas that are unknown to most Python developers. It also proves that Python is
a good tool to create terminal applications.

Further, experimenting and hacking with pymux will be easier than tmux, as
Python is more accessible.


The roadmap
-----------

There is no official roadmap, the code is mostly written for the fun and of
course, time is limited, but I use pymux professionally and I'm eager to
implement new ideas.

Some ideas:

- Support for color schemes.
- Support for extensions written in Python.
- Better support for scripting. (Right now, it's already possible to run pymux
  commands from inside the shell of a pane. E.g. ``pymux split-window``.
  However, status codes and feedback aren't transferred yet.)
- Improved mouse support. (Reporting of mouse movement.)
- Parts of pymux could become a library, so that any prompt_toolkit application
  can embed a vt100 terminal. (Imagine a terminal emulator embedded in `pyvim
  <https://github.com/jonathanslenders/pyvim>`_.)
- Maybe some cool widgets to traverse the windows and panes.
- Better autocompletion.


About Mac OS X support
----------------------

Pymux should work perfectly on OS X, just like on Linux systems. There is one
bug however: window names are not updated automatically according to the name
of the process. It displays ``(noname)`` on OS X.

The reason for this is that on Linux, it's very easy to get the process name.
It works by reading the content of ``/proc/(process_group)/cmdline``.  On OS X,
this appears to be a system call, named ``proc_pidinfo``. There is a library
called ``psutil`` that has the required functionality, but it's written in C. I
won't include that, we don't want to depend on modules that require
compilation. But if someone could contribute something based on ctypes, that
would be much appreciated.


Configuring
-----------

Create a file ``~/.pymux.conf``, and populate it with commands, like you can
enter at the command line. There is an `example config
<https://github.com/jonathanslenders/pymux/blob/master/examples/example-config.conf>`_
in the examples directory.


What if it crashes?
-------------------

If for some reason pymux crashes, it will attempt to write a stack trace to
``/tmp/pymux.crash``. It is possible that the user interface freezes. Please
create a GitHub issue with this stack trace.


Special thanks
--------------

- `Pyte <https://github.com/selectel/pyte>`_, for providing a working vt100
  parser. (This one is extended in order to support some xterm extensions.)
- `docopt <http://docopt.org/>`_, for parsing the command line arguments.
- `prompt_toolkit
  <https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit>`_, for the UI
  toolkit.
- `tmux <https://tmux.github.io/>`_, for the inspiration.
